DevForce 141 is a special task force of developers. Atleast, this is what we like to think of it.
We are all friends who are joining up together to make great stuff with a hope that the stuff will help us to even greater stuff :)

For now, we are active in web space and following stacks:
- Laravel/PHP
- Livewire
- JavaScript
- AlpineJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Inertia JS (Only when we really need to fuck around with SPA in Laravel ecosytem)
- Angular JS
- NodeJs
- TypeScript

### For Force Members
This organization is for collaboration. Anything that belongs to organization or something that you would like to share with organization, should go into relevant organization repositories.
